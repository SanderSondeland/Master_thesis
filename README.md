## How to run the code.
This needs to be done in Covid-19.ipynb, Draugen.ipynb, ThreeWells.ipynb and PySINDy (1).ipynb. The SINDy_lorenz_ex.ipynb everything is ready.
The code is almost ready to run. 

You need to copy the raw-link to the dataset and paste it in the code where it says url = "raw-link".

Then everything is ready to go if the packages that is needed is downloaded.
